1. modifying factors in simulation.py
# ZFACTOR is the conversion relationship between elevation and horizontal distance. Please refer to the explanation of the Slope tool z_factor in ArcGIS
# DELEV is the model parameter, soil grain height, see paper
# CUTOFF is the model parameter, the runoff cut-off threshold, the default value is recommended to be 0.5, see the paper
# Name the initial DEM as dem0.tif
# Modifing dem_path to point to the path where dem0.tif is located
# Modifing workspace to point to the folder where the results of the run will be stored
